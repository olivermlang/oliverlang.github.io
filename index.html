   <h3 id="book">Dissertation Project: <i>Propaganda and the logic of competition in autocratic media markets</i></h3>


       <p>My dissertation project examines the most popular source of news in modern autocratic regimes since the turn of the century: television news. In recent decades, autocracies around the world have ended state broadcaster monopolies over the production of television news, opening up markets to competition between nominally private outlets. Building on 25 years of data on outlet competition in the market for television news across fifty-seven autocracies, my dissertation examines why autocracies choose to introduce markets for news, how market structure is shaped by and interacts with repression, and the consequences of these developments for information control and regime stability under authoritarian rule.

              <li>Tribal voting in new democracies: evidence from 6 million Tunisian voter records</a>. (with Alexandra Blackman, Steven Brooke, and Gabriel Koehler-Derrick) </i></b>. </li>
                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>Do voters reward candidates who share their tribal identity? Does this relationship hold even where tribal identity was repressed for decades? These questions are difficult to answer using observational data because of measurement challenges, selection problems, or both. We address these questions using new evidence from Tunisia, where since independence governments tried to \emph{uproot} tribal identity.  To estimate the effect of tribal influence on voting, we match a historical dictionary of Tunisian tribes to surnames from the universe of both registered voters and candidates from Tunisia's recent local elections (2018).  We find that lists whose candidates share a tribal identity with voters outperform lists who do not share this identity in elections widely judged to be free and fair.  Our findings suggests that despite active repression for decades, tribal identity exerted a measurable effect on local politics during a fleeting period of democratic transition.</p>

                <li>How Increasing Refugee Visibility on TV News Causes
                    Viewers to Support Refugees More, but Like Them Less</a> (with Adeline Lo). Reject and resubmit, <b><i>Journal of Politics</i></b></li>
                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                    As global refugee flows accelerate, so does local news coverage on the subject and the potential for major political consequences.  In an analysis of all broadcasts of the most famous television news program in Germany 2013-2019, we first show observationally (through text and image analysis) that refugee coverage increases with immigration and is correlated in different ways with public opinion about refugees. Conditioning on these patterns, we then implement a nationally representative block randomized media experiment. We find that TV news coverage of refugees causes viewers to be more willing to donate money to pro-refugee organizations, but surprisingly to feel colder and more socially distant towards them. We discuss the far reaching consequences of this divergent pattern for the future of local politics in refugee-hosting countries.

               This article introduces the 50stateSimulations, a collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying code developed by the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project. The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial eforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specifc redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete workfow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states. The resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We also provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for customized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available. This article details the design, creation, and validation of the data.

              <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                The political science math prefresher arose a quarter-century ago and has now spread to many of our discipline’s PhD programs. Incoming students arrive for graduate school a few weeks early for ungraded instruction in math, statistics, and computer science  as  they  relate  to  political  science.  The  prefresher’s  benefits,  however,  go  beyond  its  technical content: it opens pathways to mastering methods necessary for political science research, facilitates connections among peers, and &mdash; perhaps most important &mdash; eases the transition to the increasingly collaborative nature of graduate work. The prefresher also shows how faculty across a highly diverse discipline have worked together to train the next generation. We review this program and advance its collaborative aspects by building infrastructure to share teaching content across universities so that separate programs can build on one another’s work and improve all of our programs.</details>

                 <details><summary>Course Description</summary><p>The United States Congress is arguably the most powerful legislature in the world. Its actions—and inaction—affect taxes, healthcare, business, the environment, and international politics. To understand the nature of legislative power in Congress and in democracies more broadly, we ask: How do successful politicians become powerful? How do they navigate rules and institutions to their advantage? What is the proper role of the lawmaking in regulating private business? Should we limit legislative lobbying and put a cap on campaign contributions? Class discussions use case studies including the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, the Tax Reform Act under Reagan, and the Affordable Care Act under Obama. Exercises include coding and data analysis. The goal is to equip students with a broad understanding of the principles of politics, economics, public policy, and data science.</p>

               <details><summary>Course Description</summary><p>Research designs are strategies to obtain empirical answers to theoretical questions. Research designs using quantitative data for social science questions are more important than ever. This class, intended for advanced students interested in social science research, trains students with best practices for designing and implementing rigorous quantitative research. We cover designs in causal inference, prediction, and missing data at a high level. This is a hands-on, application-oriented class. Exercises involve programming and statistics in addition to the social sciences (politics, economics, and policy). The final project advances a research question chosen in consultation with the instructor. </p> <p>Prerequisite: Any statistics or data science course that teaches ordinary least squares regression.

              <details><summary>Course Description</summary><p>This graduate-level seminar covers foundational work on electoral politics in the United States, with some comparisons with other countries' systems and domestic proposals for reform. Readings examine work on elite position-taking, re-election, federalism, representation, and electoral systems. Accompanying readings include similar and more recent articles in comparative politics, political economy, or election law. This course has two intended audiences: students in American Politics, and students outside American Politics interested in theories of electoral democracy developed in the American Politics subfield that have then been exported to other subfields. Class emphasizes empirical research designs and analysis of available datasets in addition to reading.</p>

     <b>About the banner image:</b> Survey data from the <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/II2DB6">Cumulative CCES</a>, limited to validated voters in contested districts who voted for a major party in the Presidency and House. Estimates are
     made at the congressional district level and use Multilevel Regression Poststratification (<a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep/">MRP</a>) stratifying on age, gender, education from the ACS and using House candidate incumbency
     status and presidential voteshare as district-level predictors. In presidential years the values represent ticket splitting (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2016 Democratic House candidate); in midterm years they represent party switch from
     the previous presidential election (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2018 Democratic House candidate). Districts where a Democrat and Republican candidate did not contest the general election are left blank. <i>Figure created by Shiro
